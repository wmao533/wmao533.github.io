        As of Sept 2019, I got my PhD from the ECE Department at the <a href="http://www.utexas.edu">University of Texas at Austin</a>. I am fortunate to be advised by <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~sanghavi/">Sujay Sanghavi</a> and <a href="http://users.ece.utexas.edu/~dimakis/">Alex Dimakis</a>. My next stop is Google Research, with a focus on <a href="https://federated.withgoogle.com/">Federated Learning</a>. I got my BS degree in 2011 and MS degree in 2014 from <a href="http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn">Shanghai Jiao Tong University</a>, advised by <a href="http://umji.sjtu.edu.cn/faculty/xudong-wang/">Xudong Wang</a>.

       My PhD research focuses on large-scale machine learning, which can be splitted into two parts: the <b>algorithm/theory</b> part and the <b>practice/implementation</b> part. For the algorithm/theory part, I have worked on several different projects, including graphical models, dimensionality reduction, compressed sensing, gradient tree boosting, neural networks, kernel learning, collaborative ranking, and natural language processing. For the practice/implementation part, I have used different platforms/libraries, including Apache Spark, XGBoost, scikit-learn, Tensorflow, PyTorch, and Gurobi. Code of some projects can be found under <a href="https://github.com/wushanshan">my GitHub</a>.
